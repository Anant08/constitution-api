# ConstitutionTech

ConstitutionTech is an API for the U.S. Constitution. It is currently in an early stage, but here are a few of the intended features:

- Retrieve the entire US Constitution as txt
- Retrieve the entire US Constitution as json
- Retrieve the entire US Constitution as a .json file with metadata, including:
	- timestamps associated with each amendment
	- commentary about each article, section
- Retrieve a list of U.S. Supreme Court cases as json

I followed [this guide] to set up the server. It is built with the Django REST Framework
